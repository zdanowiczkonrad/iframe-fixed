<h1>Iframe overflow scrolling with <code>position: fixed;</code></h1>
<p>This demo includes cross-browser samples of <code>iframe</code> elements that have <code>position: fixed</code> (ie. overlay modal with iframe content) and has scrollable contents <em>(iframe's content height is larger than the parent document height)</em>.</p>

<p>For most browser this is a no-brainer, but iOS Safari does not simply render iframe's overflow - it renders iframe's overflow as <code>visible</code> without possibility to change it and the scroll events are bubbled under the iframe, to the document body usually, which is something you usually don't desire.</p>

<p>This code solves issues mentioned above and works almost identically for following browsers:</p>

<h3>Desktop</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome 51.0.2704.84</li>
	<li>Firefox 47.0</li>
	<li>Safari 9.1 (11601.5.17.1)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mobile</h3>
<ul>
	<li>iOS Safari 9.3 (13E230)</li>
	<li>Chrome 50.0.266.89</li>
</ul>
